In 1926, Hugh Ruttledge, the deputy commissioner of Almora, visited the area to meet the Garpon (local Tibetan leader) of Ngari. As the Garpon was away, he circumbulated Mount Kailash while studying it.[36] As per Ruttledge, the mountain was about 6,000 m (20,000 ft) high and utterly unclimbable.[37] He thought about an ascent along the northeast ridge and had been exploring the area with Colonel R. C. Wilson, who was on the other side of the mountain with a Sherpa named Tseten. As per Wilson, Tseten told him that the southeast ridge represented a feasible route to the summit. Wilson explained that although they attempted to climb the mountain, they ran into heavy snowfall, making the ascent impossible.[38][39]

Herbert Tichy visited the area in 1936, attempting to climb the mountain.[40] When he asked the local people whether Kailash was climbable, a Garpon replied: "Only a man entirely free of sin could climb Kailash. And he wouldn't have to actually scale the sheer walls of ice to do it â€“ he'd just turn himself into a bird and fly to the summit".[41] Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner was given the opportunity by the Chinese government to climb the mountain in the mid-1980s. But he reportedly declined, saying "If we conquer this mountain, then we conquer something in people's souls. I would suggest they go and climb something a little harder."[42][43][44] In 2001, permission was denied to a Spanish team, who requested to climb the peak.[45] Chinese authorities promised that any climbing activities on Mount Kailash were strictly prohibited.[42][46] As of 2023, there have been no known successful ascents of the mountain.[43][45]
