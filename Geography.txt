Mount Kailash is located in Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region of China.[8][9] It lies in the GangdisÃª Mountains (also called as Kailash Range) of the Transhimalaya, in the western part of the Tibetan Plateau. The peak of Mount Kailash is at an elevation of 6,638 m (21,778 ft).[13][14] The region is located north of the western tripoint of the border between China, India and Nepal.[15]

The major rivers rising from the western Gangdise mountains are the Yarlung Tsangpo (which becomes the Brahmaputra), the Indus, the Sutlej and the Karnali, a tributary of Ganges. All these river systems originate within a 60 km (37 mi) stretch in the region.[13][16][17] Mount Kailash is located on the banks of Manasarovar and Rakshastal lakes. Spread over an area of 320 km2 (120 sq mi), Manasarovar is the highest freshwater lake in the world.[16][18][19]
